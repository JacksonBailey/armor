# Armor

I was fed up with all the tools and websites showing the materials for upgrades
in Breath of the Wild so I made my own. You can access it [here][1].

## TODO

1. Consider sorting armors and materials in the order they appear in the
   inventory.
2. Consider breaking down what each material is needed by in the bottom.
3. Consider adding defense values and effects. (Never images!)
4. Consider adding initial costs.
